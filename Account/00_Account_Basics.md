# Basics of AWS account

### ⚡ _What is Account?_
An AWS account is a container for your AWS resources. You create and manage your AWS resources in an AWS account, and the AWS account provides administrative capabilities for access and billing.

Using multiple AWS accounts is a best practice for scaling your environment, as it provides a natural billing boundary for costs, isolates resources for security, gives flexibility or individuals and teams, in addition to being adaptable for new business processes.
